Description of the Java Code: Real-Time Document Collaboration with WebSockets and REST API in Spring Boot
The provided Java code is a Spring Boot application that facilitates real-time collaboration on documents using WebSockets for live updates and REST APIs for document management. The application is composed of several components, each serving a distinct function in the overall system. Below is a breakdown of its key features and components:

1. Main Class: CollaborationApplication
Purpose: This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
Annotations:
@SpringBootApplication: Marks this class as the main Spring Boot application class, which will automatically configure and launch the application.
Method:
The main method runs the Spring Boot application using SpringApplication.run().
2. WebSocket Configuration
The application uses WebSockets to enable real-time communication between users for collaborative document editing. This is configured in the WebSocketConfig class.

WebSocketConfig Class
Annotation:
@Configuration: Marks this class as a configuration class.
@EnableWebSocket: Enables WebSocket support in the Spring application.
WebSocketConfigurer Interface:
The class implements the WebSocketConfigurer interface to configure WebSocket handlers.
The registerWebSocketHandlers() method registers the CollaborationHandler to handle WebSocket connections at the /collaborate endpoint and allows cross-origin requests by setting setAllowedOrigins("*").
3. WebSocket Handler: CollaborationHandler
Purpose: This handler handles WebSocket communication, enabling real-time collaboration by broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
Key Methods:
afterConnectionEstablished:
Called when a new WebSocket connection is established. It adds the WebSocket session to the sessions map.
handleTextMessage:
Handles text messages from a WebSocket client. When a message is received, it is broadcast to all other connected clients (excluding the sender).
afterConnectionClosed:
Removes the session from the sessions map when the WebSocket connection is closed.
4. Document Management API
A set of RESTful endpoints is created to manage documents. These endpoints allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete documents.

DocumentController Class
Annotations:
@RestController: Indicates that this class is a REST controller that will handle HTTP requests and responses.
@RequestMapping("/api/documents"): Specifies the base URL path for all document-related endpoints (/api/documents).
Key Endpoints:
GET /api/documents: Retrieves a list of all documents stored in the system.
POST /api/documents: Creates a new document. It receives a Document object in the request body and returns the created document with a generated ID.
GET /api/documents/{id}: Retrieves a specific document by its ID.
PUT /api/documents/{id}: Updates an existing document identified by the ID. It updates the title and content of the document.
DELETE /api/documents/{id}: Deletes a document by its ID.
5. Document Model: Document
The Document class represents a document in the system with the following fields:

id: A unique identifier for the document.
title: The title of the document.
content: The content of the document.
Getters and Setters: These methods are used to access and modify the documentâ€™s properties.

6. Key Features and Workflow
Real-Time Collaboration with WebSockets:
Clients can connect to the /collaborate WebSocket endpoint to receive and send real-time updates on the document.
Each connected client will receive text messages (e.g., document updates or comments) from other clients in real-time.
The WebSocket handler (CollaborationHandler) ensures that all active sessions (clients) are notified of updates.
Document Management via REST API:
Users can manage documents through standard REST API endpoints.
The application supports creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents.
Documents are stored in an in-memory ConcurrentHashMap, which is thread-safe and ensures that multiple users can interact with the documents concurrently.
Scalability:
The WebSocket implementation allows real-time updates to be pushed to all users connected to the /collaborate endpoint.
The REST API allows external clients to interact with the document database, making it suitable for various use cases beyond the collaborative editing feature.
